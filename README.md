DEMO:http://codepen.io/vogtn/pen/BzyPww

####The purpose of this app is to use the openweathermap.org api to create a functional weather forecast based on the location of the user. This utilizes: 

   *javascript
   
   *CSS
   
   *HTML(Bootstrap)
   
   *jQuery
   
   *JSON

What I learned: 
  1. How to use JSON to grab location services from the browser (and ultimately the user) 
  2. Reading API docs and understanding how to utilize them. 
  3. Using AJAX and jQuery to create responsive CSS.
